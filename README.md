# USA-Property-Price-Analysis

## Overview

This project focus on building and evaluating predictive models for property prices. Using a dataset of 3970 property sales, we explore, preprocess, and build regression and decision tree models to predict housing prices. The project utilizes R for data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and model development.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on 3970 property sales, including various features such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, population of the area, and the price of the house.

## Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We explore the dataset by checking for missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables.
- **Data Preprocessing:** We select features and the target variable, handle missing values, and transform variables as needed.
- **Model Building:** We build regression models using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and other techniques, as well as decision tree models.
- **Model Evaluation:** We evaluate the models using metrics such as RMSE, R-squared, and MAE.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, is needed:

- R version 4.0.0 or higher
- RStudio (optional but recommended for running .Rmd files)
- The following R libraries:

### Project Results
The project results will help determine the most effective predictive model to assess property prices. The final model will be validated using unseen data, and recommendations will be provided for further refinement of the prediction process.

### Future Work
The current project focuses on model building and evaluation. Future steps include applying the developed model to new datasets and exploring additional model optimization techniques.
